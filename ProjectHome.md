This project is created by 3 students of Computer Science at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology within the academic course Agile Software Development. Our goal is to develop web application that supports planning process in project management. It allows to enter tasks that need to be done within the current iteration (sprint), assign them to project members, prioritize and export as a grafical PDF file ready to print and hang on the wall. We also consider a feature that will export tasks from existing Jira project.
